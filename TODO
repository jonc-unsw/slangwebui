Important
* Keep third party code in sepate files etc when ugligying them
* https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook#external-bundles

New
* Deal with multiple node/edge selections
* IE8
* Add new tab that shows trees...

Change
* Make gruntfile better
* Prop validation
* Should react look after the state of the graph or should cytoscape???
  If cy does then we need to use plain js to access it
  If react does then we need to make action/store
* Possible to use @decorators for common actions/stores eg toggleAccordion?
* Clean up source loading
* Make slang output better - do this when i refactor the code???
  Eg there are multiple compiler instances for each source file which means
  it is really hard to figure out which stmt belongs to what source file
  If i refactor to use a newer clang then i might be able to use 1 compilerinstance
  Also need to write c++ code to generate bb.json since it currently uses inbuilt llvm dump()
* Manually fix fib/graph.json to have correct line numbers
* Manually write the BB for fib
