New
* Deal with multiple node/edge selections
* IE8
* Add new tab that shows trees...

Change
* Make gruntfile better
* Prop validation
* Should react look after the state of the graph or should cytoscape???
  If cy does then we need to use plain js to access it
  If react does then we need to make action/store
* Possible to use @decorators for common actions/stores eg toggleAccordion?
* Clean up source loading
* Make slang output better - do this when i refactor the code???
