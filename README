Slang GUI

This is the slang webui frontend. It is a work in progress.

Instructions:
The grunt build tool is used. Make sure that you have set up npm correctly

Single compile: "grunt browserify"
Watching files: "grunt watch" or just "grunt"
Build static files eg css and js: "grunt cssmin" and "grunt uglify"

Start a webserver like "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" in the proj dir and you
can view the site.

Features:
* Written in modern javascapt (es6 2015) and is transcompiled into es5 to work
  with current web browsers. Can make pure es6 optional when the major browsers
  bring in support.
* Uses Reactjs. This is a js library from facebook to write user interfaces.
  It is the V in MVC
* Uses Flux architecture. This works well with React. It is a uni directional 
  data flow pattern. We are using the Alt implementation

Source Layout:
* Has an index.html page with placeholders for the js to bind to.
* React code is in src/ There are 3 main components. Action, Components, Stores
  * Components are classes much like classes in Java OO
  * Actions are called from components which update the store
  * Stores maintain the state of the application
